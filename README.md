# This Java code defines a Grades class that keeps track of grades for a specific lesson. 
The class has a constructor that takes a string parameter representing the lesson name, and a list of doubles to store grades for that lesson. The class has two methods: addGrade() to add a new grade to the list, and getAverrage() to calculate and return the average grade for that lesson, excluding the highest and lowest grades.

The main method creates two instances of the Grades class, one for the "Informatyka" lesson, and another one for the same lesson but with different grades. It adds grades to each instance using the addGrade() method, and then calls the getAverrage() method to get the average grade for each instance.

Overall, this code demonstrates the use of classes and methods to perform a specific task in Java. It also shows how to use ArrayList and Collections classes to manipulate lists and find the maximum and minimum values in a list.
